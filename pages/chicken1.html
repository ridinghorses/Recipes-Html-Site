    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
            <li>20 dried apricots</li>
            <li> cup chicken stock</li>
            <li> cup apricot preserves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (Optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet 
            with a lid over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, 
            and cook in the hot oil until golden brown around the edges, but still pink in the center, 
            about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook for about 3 minutes more. Pour in the balsamic vinegar,
             bring it to a simmer, and allow it to reduce for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Cut half of the apricots in half, 
            leaving the others whole. 
            Place the apricots into the skillet, and pour in the chicken stock. 
            Bring to a simmer, then stir in the apricot preserves and thyme. 
            Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the apricots have softened, 10 to 15 minutes. 
            Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.
        </li> 
    </ol>
